# hjb.dev Laravel Base
I like spinning up little side projects with Jetstream and Laravel. There are a couple of tweaks I make consistently - which is what this repository started as.

I've ended up doing a frontend rework as I tend to prefer sidebar layouts in admin panels than the top navigation bar Jetstream ships with.

## Features
* Laravel Jetstream via (JoelButcher/SocialStream)
* OAuth Login (JoelButcher/SocialStream)
* Sidebar admin layout
