# hjb.dev Laravel Base

I like spinning up little side projects with Jetstream and Laravel. There are a couple of tweaks I make consistently - which is what this repository started as.

I've ended up doing a frontend rework as I tend to prefer sidebar layouts in admin panels than the top navigation bar Jetstream ships with.

## Features

-   Laravel Jetstream via (JoelButcher/SocialStream)
-   OAuth Login (JoelButcher/SocialStream)
-   Sidebar admin layout

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hjbdev/laravel-base.git
cd laravel-base && ./setup.sh
```
